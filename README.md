I have this program set up to run with Lingon, an automatic job runner, every morning. The program uses Java and selenium webdriver to fetch all my account balances across multiple banks and companies and uses java mail to email them to me on a daily basis.

TODO:

- Use PhantomJS so program can run in the background.
